## INTRODUCTION

Meria's 'Social Media Text Annotator' for social media text samples was created by Merja Kreivi-Kauppinen (2021-2022) at University of Oulu as a part of scientific work of my Master’s thesis. 

The design of 'Social Media Text Annotator' was implemented on basis of 'HS Annotation Framework' to smooth and facilitate manual labeling process of sentiment and hate speech (HS) annotation of Finnish social media text samples.

The technical design and development of 'Social Media Text Annotator' was implemented on the basis of 'HS Annotation Framework' reported on Master’s Thesis research paper - 
Merja Kreivi-Kauppinen (2024) Signs of Paradigm Shift in Hate Speech Detection Methodology: Hate Speech Detection of Dialectal, Granular and Urban Finnish. University of Oulu, Degree Programme in Computer Science and Engineering. Master’s Thesis, 111 p.

Meria's Annotator includes small GUI for the Social-Media-Text-Annotator API. The 'Social Media Text Annotator' was conducted mainly on python coding language with Restful Web SPA, Flask RESTful, Flask SQLAlchemy, SQLite, jQuery, Vanilla JavaScript, CSS Bootstrap and HTML methodologies. Working process included designing, coding, debugging, and testing phases of the Web API. 

The designed 'Social Media Text Annotator' presents schematic structure of hate speech (HS) categories and subcategories for manual labeling process of Finnish social media data. With help of the Social-Media-Text-Annotator API client you can import social media text samples into database, manually label saved text samples, and keep all samples and annotations available in the database. 
API and database create an environment for multiple users.


## HATE SPEECH (HS) ANNOTATION FRAMEWORK 

The 'HS Annotation Framework' is presented shortly in 'readme_Hate_Speech_Annotation_Framework' -file.

Hate Speech Annotation Framework and Social-Media-Text-Annotator Web API are under construction and development work, and therefore published application includes unfinished and undefined categories and subcategories. 


## INSTALL, SET UP VENV, and RUN

The instructions how to install, set up virtual environment, run, and quit API is presented shortly in 'readme_How_to_install_and_run' -file.
